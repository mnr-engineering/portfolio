        <h2>Hi, I'm Mo.</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Mechanical Engineering student who learns best by building real systems, 
            breaking things, and figuring out how they work. My focus is hands-on engineering — 
            turning theory into working hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve worked on projects involving aerodynamics, electronics integration, control systems, 
            and mechanical design. From building a desktop wind tunnel to configuring a Cube Orange 
            flight controller for a VTOL aircraft, I enjoy solving practical engineering problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to become an engineer who understands the full system — mechanical, electrical, 
            and control — not just one piece of it.

    <h2>How I Approach Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        I believe engineering is learned through building, testing, failing, and improving. 
        Every project I take on is an opportunity to understand systems deeper — not just to make 
        something that works, but to understand why it works.
